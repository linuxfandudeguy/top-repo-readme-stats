  > This API uses caching by using [**`node-cache`**](https://github.com/node-cache/node-cache) and caches 10 minutes in order to prevent GitHub API limits, meaning the statistics might not update in real time.

This project was heavily influenced by [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats/tree/master) and has its design taken from it.

Credits to [anuraghazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra) for design inspiration and inspiration in general.

## Usage

To put this in your profile README file, make sure that you have already created it first before implementing it. If you have done that, then put this in whatever section of your README file you want to put it in like this:

```html
  <img src="https://popularrepostats.vercel.app/popular-repos?username=your_github_username" alt="most popular repositories"/>
```

Replace `your_github_username` with your actual GitHub username.
